<h3>How does C Programming Language Work?</h3>
<h4>
    Execution of the C program involves 5 steps.<br>These are:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Creating the Program <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Preprocessing <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Compiling the Program<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Linking the Program with functions from the C library<br>
